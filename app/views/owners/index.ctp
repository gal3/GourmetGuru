		<h2>Quick Guide</h2>

		<p>Under My Store section, it allows the owners to take a quick glance of the information per restaurant. Within this view, it also allows the option to edit, view foods, and view set menus.</p>
		<p> Creating a new store is easy, just click the button "Add store" and follow the form and submit! Simple!</p>
		<p>Next section is order history. The owner has to choose which restuarant he/she wants to look at first, since this order history view is per restaurant.</p>
		<p>Statistic section allows to track various stats they may care about, if it doesnt exist, they can contact us!</p>
		<p>Under My Profile is personal information and account settings, very similar to customer section,except without the preferences, since we do not need those options for the owners.</p>
